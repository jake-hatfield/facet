# Facet

## ðŸ”Ž Description

Facet is a fullstack application that helps people find the right jeweler for purchasing an engagement ring for their loved one. I built this to push myself out of my technology comfort zone. I intentionally picked three new technologies to create Facet: Angular, Python, and Django. And though I've used Postgres for 2 projects in the past, it's been through [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). In this project, I'm building a Postgres database on my own to eliminate abstractions and make sure I have a really solid understanding of this technology.

## ðŸ¤– Tech stack

- Angular
- TailwindCSS
- Python
- Django
- Postgres
- Heroicons

## ðŸ”® Future plans

This project ended up being more frontend-heavy than I expected. I learned a lot with Angular, and I'd like to learn more on Django. This will likely look like me building out features using the included services, like auth. So far, I've really enjoyed the simplicity of Python over JavaScript.
